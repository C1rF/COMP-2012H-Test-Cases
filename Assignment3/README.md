# There are 3 tests for Assignment3
### Contributed By Lao_JK
Please note that all of them have different map size, **the test1 is suitable for debugging**!

And a reminder, I did NOT write enough case to test the function __is_valid_path__ when the path is not vaild!

For other functions, I tried my best to cover all the cases, but still, **it is not a guarantee**. Do write your own test cases and welcome to contribute!

Finally don't forget to test your program using [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) to make sure you can pass the memory check.

Good Luck :)
