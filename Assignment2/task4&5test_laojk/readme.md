## It tests for task 4&5
You may use the latest version of demo program to test the input first!

Please note that all the functions in task4&5 was covered.

But, there still have chance that even you passed the test, there is still error in your code! 

And for the memory check, you can use tool called **Valgrind** or **mtrace**

[Here](http://senlinzhan.github.io/2017/12/31/valgrind/) is a quick start of Valgrind.
